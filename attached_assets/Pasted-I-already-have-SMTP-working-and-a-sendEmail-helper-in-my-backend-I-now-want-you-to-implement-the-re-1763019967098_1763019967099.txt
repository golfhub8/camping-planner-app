I already have SMTP working and a sendEmail helper in my backend. I now want you to implement the remaining email templates starting from #3:
	3.	Renewal Reminder Email
	4.	Payment Failed Email
	5.	Trial Started Email
	6.	Trial Ending Soon Email
	7.	Cancellation Confirmation Email

Create each email as a separate file under src/emails/. Reuse the existing mailer utility (sendEmail) rather than creating a new transporter. Each email must support HTML and text versions, accept a name field that defaults to “camper”, format currency amounts from cents into a human-readable string, and use a shared date formatting helper if needed.

Also create a barrel export file at src/emails/index.ts that re-exports all new email functions.

Here are the specifications for EACH email:

⸻

EMAIL 3 — RENEWAL REMINDER EMAIL
File: src/emails/renewalReminder.ts

Create a function:
export async function sendRenewalReminderEmail(options: {
to: string;
name?: string;
renewalDate: Date;
amount: number;
currency: string;
manageBillingUrl?: string;
})

Subject:
Your Camping Planner Pro renewal is coming up

HTML body:
“Hi {{name}},
Just a quick heads up — your Camping Planner Pro subscription is scheduled to renew on {{renewalDateFormatted}}.
On that date, we’ll automatically charge {{amountFormatted}} to your saved payment method to keep your Pro benefits active:
• Unlimited trips & grocery lists
• Full access to all printable planners & games
• Premium packing checklists
• Priority feature updates
If you want to update your card or cancel before renewal, you can manage your subscription here: {{manageBillingUrl}}
If everything looks good, you don’t need to do anything — your plan will renew automatically.
Happy camping,
The Camping Planner Team”

Plain text version should mirror the same content.

⸻

EMAIL 4 — PAYMENT FAILED
File: src/emails/paymentFailed.ts

Create a function:
export async function sendPaymentFailedEmail(options: {
to: string;
name?: string;
amount: number;
currency: string;
manageBillingUrl?: string;
})

Subject:
We couldn’t process your Camping Planner Pro payment

HTML body:
“Hi {{name}},
We tried to process your latest Camping Planner Pro payment for {{amountFormatted}}, but your bank declined the charge.
This can happen if a card expires, a bank blocks the transaction, or there are insufficient funds.
Please update your payment method or retry the payment here: {{manageBillingUrl}}
We’ll keep your Pro features available for a short grace period. If payment still fails, your subscription may be paused.
If you believe this was a mistake, reply to this email.
Thank you,
The Camping Planner Team”

Plain text version should match the above.

⸻

EMAIL 5 — TRIAL STARTED
File: src/emails/trialStarted.ts

Create a function:
export async function sendTrialStartedEmail(options: {
to: string;
name?: string;
trialEndDate: Date;
manageBillingUrl?: string;
})

Subject:
Your Camping Planner Pro trial is live!

HTML body:
“Hi {{name}},
Welcome to your Camping Planner Pro trial!
For the next 7 days (until {{trialEndDateFormatted}}), you’ll have full access to:
• Unlimited trips
• Unlimited grocery lists
• All printable planners & game bundles
• Premium packing checklists
• Offline-ready saved recipes
If you’re enjoying Pro, you don’t need to do anything — your subscription will continue automatically.
To review or cancel your trial, visit: {{manageBillingUrl}}
Happy camping,
The Camping Planner Team”

Plain text version should match the above.

⸻

EMAIL 6 — TRIAL ENDING SOON
File: src/emails/trialEndingSoon.ts

Create a function:
export async function sendTrialEndingSoonEmail(options: {
to: string;
name?: string;
trialEndDate: Date;
amount: number;
currency: string;
manageBillingUrl?: string;
})

Subject:
Your Camping Planner Pro trial ends soon

HTML body:
“Hi {{name}},
Just a reminder — your Camping Planner Pro trial ends on {{trialEndDateFormatted}}.
Unless canceled before that date, your subscription will continue and you’ll be charged {{amountFormatted}} for the next billing period.
With Pro, you’ll keep access to:
• Unlimited trips and grocery lists
• All printable planners and games
• Premium packing checklists
• Offline-ready recipe saving
Manage your subscription here: {{manageBillingUrl}}
Happy camping,
The Camping Planner Team”

Plain text version should match the above.

⸻

EMAIL 7 — CANCELLATION CONFIRMATION
File: src/emails/cancellation.ts

Create a function:
export async function sendCancellationEmail(options: {
to: string;
name?: string;
currentPeriodEnd?: Date;
reactivateUrl?: string;
})

Subject:
Your Camping Planner Pro subscription has been cancelled

HTML body:
“Hi {{name}},
This is a confirmation that your Camping Planner Pro subscription has been cancelled.
{{If currentPeriodEnd exists}}
You will continue to have Pro access until {{currentPeriodEndFormatted}}.
{{Else}}
Your account will now return to the free plan.
{{End}}
If you change your mind, you can restart your Pro membership here: {{reactivateUrl}}
Thank you for being part of The Camping Planner community.
The Camping Planner Team”

Plain text version should match the above.

⸻

Finally, create src/emails/index.ts that exports:

sendRenewalReminderEmail
sendPaymentFailedEmail
sendTrialStartedEmail
sendTrialEndingSoonEmail
sendCancellationEmail

Use named exports.

Make sure the code is clean, typed, and consistent across all files. Reuse formatting helpers for dates and currency.

END OF PROMPT.
