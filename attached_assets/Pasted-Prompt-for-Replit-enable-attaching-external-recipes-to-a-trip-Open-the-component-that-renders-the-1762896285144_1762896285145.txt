Prompt for Replit – enable attaching external recipes to a trip

Open the component that renders the “From TheCampingPlanner.com” recipe cards (it’s probably ExternalRecipeCard.tsx or inside Recipes.tsx where we map externalRecipes).

Add a small action button on each external recipe: “Add to Trip”.

When clicked, open the same trip-select modal/drawer we use for normal recipes (if we don’t have one yet, create a very simple one that fetches /api/trips and lets me pick one).

When I pick a trip, POST to:
POST /api/trips/:tripId/meals
body: { recipeId: externalRecipe.id, isExternal: true, title: externalRecipe.title, sourceUrl: externalRecipe.url }

On the backend, update the trip_meals creation logic to allow external recipes (no strict foreign key to recipes table) if isExternal === true.

Show a success toast “Recipe added to trip”.

Tell me which files you changed.

That will let you plan a trip using your blog content 👌

2. Trip form date looks weird / can’t type date

That’s usually because the input is type="date" but we’re trying to manually type MM/DD/YYYY while the browser wants YYYY-MM-DD.

So: we tell Replit to normalize.

Prompt for Replit – normalize trip date inputs

Open the trip create/edit form component (the one used on /trips/new and the “Edit Trip” button).

Make both startDate and endDate use <input type="date" /> bound to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

When loading an existing trip, if the date is like 2025-11-28T00:00:00.000Z, format it to 2025-11-28 before putting it in the input.

When submitting, send the date as ISO (2025-11-28) to the backend.

Add a placeholder text under the field: “Use the date picker”.

Tell me which files you changed.

That will stop the “comes out strange” thing.

3. Location search not pulling cities + double header

Two parts.

3a. Location not found

Your trip editor is probably just saving the raw text and not actually geocoding unless you have a token. So Los Angeles → no coords → weather says “no coordinates”.

So we tell Replit: if geocoding env isn’t set, just save the text, but don’t pretend it failed.

Prompt for Replit – improve trip location UX

In the trip create/edit form, allow any text location to be saved (don’t block on geocoding).

After saving, show “This trip doesn’t have coordinates yet. Add latitude and longitude to see weather.” only if lat and lng are actually missing.

In the backend, if there is no geocoding token, don’t throw — just save the location string.

That way you can at least save “Los Angeles”.

If you actually want auto-lat/lng for cities, we can later add OpenCage or Mapbox.

3b. Double header

You’ve got the app header (Recipes | Trips | Map | Printables) and then the trip page added another top bar. Tell Replit to remove the extra one.

Prompt – remove duplicate header on trip detail

Open the trip detail page (where it shows “California”, weather, collaborators).

It currently renders its own top navigation/header in addition to the global app navbar.

Remove the extra header so only the global navbar is shown.

Keep the “Back to Trips” link.

4. Printables + ThriveCart + Pro membership

Right now you sell on ThriveCart, but the app says “Pro membership gets printables.” You’ve got two paths:

Option A (simplest): host PDFs in the app

Upload your PDFs to the app (they already look like they’re listed).

Gate the download buttons behind user.isPro === true.

Keep ThriveCart on your site but change the website wording to: “Want all printables? Get the Camping Planner app (Pro).”

This is the cleanest because the app controls access.

Option B (keep ThriveCart separate)

Let people buy on ThriveCart like today.

After purchase, you give them a Pro account or a download link.

Harder to automate unless you send a webhook from ThriveCart into your app.

Because you already have Stripe in the app, I would do Option A.

Here’s a prompt for that:

Prompt for Replit – gate downloadable PDFs for Pro users

Open the Printables page component.

For each printable/download card, wrap the download button in a check:

if user.isPro === true → show “Download” (link to the file stored in the app)

else → show the current “Start 7-Day Free Trial ($29.99/year)” button

Make sure the download link uses the file path we already have in the backend (you set up /api/printables/downloads earlier).

Add a note at the top: “Already purchased via ThriveCart? Contact us to activate your Pro account.” (so existing buyers aren’t stuck).

Tell me which files you changed.

That aligns the app with what you’re actually selling.
