I am continuing my Node.js + Express project called “The Camping Planner.”
I already have:

a recipes feature (create, list, view recipes, stored in @replit/database), and

a grocery feature (build a grocery list from selected recipes).

Now I want to add a Trip Planner module so I can organize trips and attach meals to a specific trip.

What to build

Create a new route file called routes/trips.js and mount it in index.js at /trips.

Create a Trips Home page at GET /trips that:

lists all saved trips (trip name, destination/location, start date, end date),

has a button/form to “Create New Trip.”

Create a New Trip form at POST /trips/new that saves a trip to @replit/database.
Each trip should have at least:

id

name (e.g. “Goldstream Weekend”)

location (text, e.g. “Goldstream Provincial Park”)

startDate

endDate

meals (an array – can be empty at first)

createdAt

Create a Trip Detail page at GET /trips/:id that shows:

the trip name, dates, and location

a section called “Planned Meals for this Trip”

a button “Add a Recipe to this Trip”

When the user clicks “Add a Recipe to this Trip,” show a page at GET /trips/:id/add-meal that lists all existing recipes (reuse from the recipes DB) with “Add” buttons. When a recipe is added, push it into that trip’s meals array and save the trip back to the database.

On the Trip Detail page, show the list of attached recipes (by title) and include a button “Generate Grocery List for This Trip.” For now, this button can just link to /grocery with a note like: “(future) preselect recipes from this trip.”

Data / DB

Use the same @replit/database instance as the other modules.

Store trips under the key trips as an array, similar to how recipes were stored.

Code style

Please add comments because I am still learning.

Keep HTML simple (inline strings are OK).

Make navigation easy: on every trips page, include links back to / and /trips.

Prepare the routes so later I can add more sections to a trip (Packing List, Activities, Printables).

Summary of routes

GET /trips – list all trips + create form

POST /trips/new – create a trip

GET /trips/:id – view a single trip

GET /trips/:id/add-meal – list recipes to attach to this trip

POST /trips/:id/add-meal – actually attach the selected recipe

After generating the code, tell me which files were created or edited so I know where to look in Replit.
