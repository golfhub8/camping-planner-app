I already have a React + TypeScript frontend and a Node/Express backend for The Camping Planner.
The backend now supports:

GET /api/trips → list all trips

GET /trips/:id → server-side view of one trip

POST /trips/new → create a trip

POST /trips/:id/collaborators → add a collaborator (email/name)

POST /trips/:id/cost → save total grocery cost for trip

trips also have meals (array of recipe ids)

I want to add a React Trip Detail page so I can view and edit ONE trip from the frontend.

Please create a new React + TS component/page, for example src/pages/TripDetail.tsx, that:

Reads a tripId from the URL (e.g. /trips-ui/:id).

On mount, fetches the trip JSON from a new API endpoint like GET /api/trips/:id (please also show me the small Express/Node change needed to expose this JSON endpoint if it doesn’t exist yet).

Displays:

trip name, location, dates

list of collaborators

list of meals (just show titles or IDs for now)

cost section (total + per-person split if collaborators exist)

Add a small form to add a collaborator right on this page. On submit, POST to /trips/:id/collaborators and then re-fetch the trip.

Add a small form to update/set the grocery total for the trip (number input). On submit, POST to /trips/:id/cost and re-fetch the trip.

If the trip has collaborators and a total cost, display the split like:

Total: $X

People: collaborators.length + 1 (include trip owner)

Each: total / people (2 decimal places)

Include a section “Meals for this trip.” For now, just list what is in trip.meals. If you can, also fetch /api/recipes and map the recipe IDs to recipe titles.

Add basic loading and error states.

Style it to match the previous Trips page (teal header, cards, simple div layout).

Finally, update the router (e.g. in App.tsx) to add a route like <Route path="/trips-ui/:id" element={<TripDetail />} /> so that when I click a trip in the list page I can go to this detail view.

Please show:

the React component code

the small Express route to add: GET /api/trips/:id

and where to add the new route in the React router.
