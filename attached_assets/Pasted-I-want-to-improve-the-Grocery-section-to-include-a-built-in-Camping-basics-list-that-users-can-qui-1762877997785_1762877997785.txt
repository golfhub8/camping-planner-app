I want to improve the Grocery section to include a built-in “Camping basics” list that users can quickly add to their trip groceries.

What I want:

Add a static list of common camping groceries (see list below).

On the Grocery page, show a section at the top called “Camping Basics.”

Each item in “Camping Basics” should be greyed out / disabled-looking by default (not in the active shopping list yet).

When the user checks an item, it should:

become active (normal text)

be added to their current grocery list / items-to-buy

stay checked for that user (store it in the same place we store their grocery items, tied to user)

Unchecking should remove it from the active list (optional, but nice).

Keep existing behavior where users can export/send the list.

Data shape suggestion:

const CAMPING_BASICS = [
  { id: "water", name: "Drinking water / jugs", category: "Essentials" },
  { id: "coffee", name: "Coffee / tea", category: "Breakfast" },
  { id: "milk", name: "Milk / creamer", category: "Breakfast" },
  { id: "eggs", name: "Eggs", category: "Breakfast" },
  { id: "bread", name: "Bread / buns / tortillas", category: "Staples" },
  { id: "butter", name: "Butter / cooking oil / spray", category: "Cooking" },
  { id: "condiments", name: "Ketchup, mustard, relish", category: "Condiments" },
  { id: "snacks", name: "Trail mix / granola bars / chips", category: "Snacks" },
  { id: "fruit", name: "Apples / oranges / berries", category: "Produce" },
  { id: "veg", name: "Carrots / peppers / onions", category: "Produce" },
  { id: "meat", name: "Protein (hot dogs, burgers, sausage)", category: "Meals" },
  { id: "smores", name: "S'mores kit (graham, chocolate, marshmallows)", category: "Treats" },
  { id: "spices", name: "Salt, pepper, basic spices", category: "Cooking" },
  { id: "ice", name: "Ice / ice packs", category: "Cooler" },
  { id: "foil", name: "Aluminum foil / zip bags", category: "Camp kitchen" },
  { id: "paper", name: "Paper towel / napkins", category: "Camp kitchen" },
];


UI behavior:

Render this list above the user’s current grocery items.

Each item should have a checkbox and a muted style, e.g. text-muted-foreground and maybe opacity-60.

On check, call an API like POST /api/groceries with the item name so it’s saved.

After it’s added, show it in the normal grocery list area.

Frontend example (TSX):

<section>
  <h2 className="text-sm font-semibold mb-2">Camping basics</h2>
  <div className="space-y-1">
    {CAMPING_BASICS.map((item) => {
      const alreadyAdded = userGroceries.some((g) => g.name === item.name);
      return (
        <label
          key={item.id}
          className={`flex items-center gap-2 text-sm ${
            alreadyAdded ? "text-foreground" : "text-muted-foreground opacity-60"
          }`}
        >
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={alreadyAdded}
            onChange={() => handleToggleBasic(item)}
          />
          {item.name}
        </label>
      );
    })}
  </div>
</section>


Backend:

Reuse the existing groceries endpoint (whichever we already have for adding items).

In handleToggleBasic, if it’s not added → POST to /api/groceries with { name: item.name, source: "camping-basic" }.

If it is added and user unchecks → DELETE /api/groceries/:id.

Please add comments so I can extend the CAMPING_BASICS list later.
