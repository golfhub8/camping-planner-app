When a user clicks Save Recipe, the parser incorrectly extracts ingredients and instructions. It’s currently scraping random paragraphs instead of the structured recipe sections.

Goal:
Parse recipe data accurately from TheCampingPlanner.com posts using the recipe’s built-in structured sections:

✔ Must Pull Ingredients From:
Section Title: “Ingredients Checklist”

Located inside the HTML block that renders the table.

The parser should extract:

Ingredient name

Amount

Notes

⚡ Final format inserted into the app should be:

Ingredient — Amount — Notes (optional)


Example:

Steak (sirloin or ribeye) — 1 lb
Baby potatoes — 1 lb — Halved
Olive oil — 3 tbsp
Butter — 2 tbsp — For potatoes
Garlic — 2 cloves — For chimichurri
Fresh parsley — ½ cup — Chopped
Red wine vinegar — 1 tbsp
Chili flakes — pinch — Optional heat
Salt & pepper — to taste

✔ Must Pull Instructions From Two Sections:

“Home Prep Before the Trip”

“Cooking at Camp”

The app should combine these two into a single ordered instruction list.

⚡ Format for the final instructions should be:

Step 1...
Step 2...
Step 3...


Pull each numbered item as a separate step.

🔍 HTML Structure to Target

Tell your developer to scrape based on these selectors (these are consistent on all recipe pages):

Ingredients
<div class="wp-block-table"> … table rows … </div>


or detect table following an <h2> or <h3> containing:

“Ingredients Checklist”

“Ingredients”

Instructions Sections

Home Prep Before the Trip

<h2>Home Prep Before the Trip</h2>
<ol> … list items … </ol>


Cooking at Camp

<h2>Cooking at Camp</h2>
<ol> … list items … </ol>

❗Important: Do NOT Parse Sections Outside These Zones

Ignore:

Ads

Intro paragraphs

Image captions

SEO snippets

Nutritional info

Suggested recipe links

Only parse the three areas listed above.

🚀 Expected Behavior After Fix

When clicking Save Recipe:

✔ Ingredients field auto-fills with correct items
✔ Instructions field shows combined prep + camp steps
✔ No more random or irrelevant text
✔ All recipes on the site import correctly
✔ User doesn’t have to manually adjust anything
