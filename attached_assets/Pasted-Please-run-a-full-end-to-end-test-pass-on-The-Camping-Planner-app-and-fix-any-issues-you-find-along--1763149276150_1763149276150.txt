Please run a full end-to-end test pass on The Camping Planner app and fix any issues you find along the way. I want to confirm that free vs Pro, trips, recipes, grocery lists, printables, and cancel flows are all working correctly.

Start from a completely fresh account:
	1.	Create a brand-new user
– Register a new account using a fresh test email address (not one that already exists in the database).
– Confirm: signup works, verification/login works, and the account correctly shows as a free/trial user.
	2.	Plan 5 new trips on this new account
– Create 5 different trips with different locations and dates.
– Confirm each trip saves correctly and appears on the Trips page and on its own detail page (weather, hikes block, etc).
	3.	Add recipes: 5 custom + 5 suggested
a) Custom recipes
– Using the internal recipe builder, create 5 of your own recipes (title, ingredients, instructions).
– Make sure they are saved as “My Recipes” and are selectable when adding meals to a trip.
b) Suggested recipes from TheCampingPlanner.com
– From the suggested/external recipes section, save 5 different recipes into “My Recipes”.
– For each of these 5, confirm that:
• Ingredients are pulled from the correct part of the blog post (the Ingredients Checklist table).
• Instructions are pulled only from “Home Prep Before the Trip” and “Cooking at Camp”.
• There are no extra “junk” lines (ads, unrelated text, etc).
• Units and amounts are preserved correctly (cups, tbsp, ml, etc).
If any recipe fails to import (shows the red “retry auto import” banner, or 0 items / 0 steps), please fix the scraper/parser so that all official TheCampingPlanner.com recipes import cleanly. The goal is that every official recipe on the blog can be auto-saved with correct ingredients and both sets of instructions.
	4.	Meals on trips and selecting recipes
– For at least one of the new trips, add meals using the “Add Meal” button.
– When adding a meal:
• User should see both their own custom recipes and the saved suggested recipes.
• User should also have the option to “build your own meal” directly from that dialog if possible.
– Make sure the chosen recipes correctly attach to the trip and show under “Meals for this Trip”.
	5.	Build a grocery list with all ingredients
– Go to the Grocery section and “Build Your Grocery List”.
– In the top “Meals from your trips” area: select all 3+ meals from the chosen trip.
– In the “Select Recipes” area: also select all 10 recipes (5 custom + 5 suggested).
– Confirm:
• All selected recipes are actually included in the grocery list.
• All ingredients from these recipes are combined into the grocery list.
• Ingredients are categorized correctly (Dairy, Meat, Pantry, etc.).
• Specifically fix the earlier issue where elbow macaroni and bread crumbs were under “Camping Gear” – they should be under Pantry, and “Camping Gear” should not be used as an ingredient category.
– Use the “share / email” feature to send a copy of the grocery list to golfhubmedia@gmail.com.
• Confirm the email sends successfully via our SMTP (hello@thecampingplanner.com through smtpout.secureserver.net on port 587) and that the grocery list is readable in the email (HTML or PDF, not a corrupted PDF).
	6.	Free plan limit: enforce 5-trip maximum
– While still on the free/trial account, attempt to create a 6th trip.
– Expected behavior:
• The 6th trip creation should be blocked.
• The user should see a clear message/upsell that they have reached the free limit and must upgrade to Pro to create more trips.
– If the app currently allows more than 5 trips on a free account, please implement and enforce the 5-trip limit.
	7.	Upgrade to Pro and verify renewal date logic
– From this same account, go through the full Pro signup flow (Stripe test mode is fine).
– After successful checkout, confirm:
• The account page shows “Pro Member” (not “Pro Trial”) and the header button also shows Pro status (not “Go Pro”).
• The renewal date shown on the account page is exactly one year from the actual subscription start date (use Stripe’s current_period_end, not a hard-coded date).
• Stripe’s subscription object for this user is set to auto-renew every 365 days / 1 year.
• Our webhook updates the user’s plan to “pro” when checkout.session.completed / customer.subscription.updated is received.
	8.	Pro features: printables and packing lists
– As a Pro member, verify that:
• All Pro printables and games are unlocked and can be downloaded.
• All PDFs open cleanly and are not corrupted (no “Failed to load PDF document” errors).
• The full “What to Pack” packing checklist at the bottom of a trip is unlocked for Pro users (not greyed out).
– Fix any remaining issues with PDF generation or file paths so downloads always work.
	9.	Cancel subscription and re-lock Pro features
– Using the “Manage Subscription” link (Stripe customer portal), cancel this user’s Pro subscription in test mode.
– Then verify via the app:
• Our Stripe webhook receives the cancellation event (customer.subscription.deleted) and updates the user’s plan back to Free/Trial.
• On the account page, the plan is no longer shown as Pro Member.
• The header button changes back from “Pro Member” to “Go Pro” or equivalent.
• All Pro-only printables are again locked (only the free printables should be downloadable).
• The full packing list / Pro-only checklists are locked again.
• Free plan limits (max 5 trips, max 5 grocery lists if applicable) are enforced again.
– Existing trips and existing grocery lists can remain visible, but the user should not be able to:
• Create additional trips beyond the free limit, or
• Download any Pro-only printable PDFs.
	10.	Clean up and logging
– Ensure the Stripe webhook endpoint we are using is the deployed one (not an old Replit preview URL that goes down when the repl sleeps).
– The webhook should always return a 2xx status for valid events, and log any failures with enough info to debug.
– Remove or update any outdated test webhook endpoints so Stripe stops sending to dead URLs.

Deliverables / acceptance:

– Free user is limited to 5 trips and cannot access Pro printables or full packing lists.
– Pro user can:
• Create unlimited trips and grocery lists,
• Save recipes (custom and external) with correct ingredients and instructions,
• Build grocery lists that include all selected recipes, categorized correctly,
• Download all Pro printables with working PDFs,
• Use full packing lists.
– When Pro is canceled, all Pro benefits are removed, and printables/packing lists are locked again.
– A test grocery list email has been successfully sent to golfhubmedia@gmail.com from hello@thecampingplanner.com.

Please implement any missing functionality and fix any bugs you find while following these steps, then re-run the full flow once to confirm everything works end-to-end.
