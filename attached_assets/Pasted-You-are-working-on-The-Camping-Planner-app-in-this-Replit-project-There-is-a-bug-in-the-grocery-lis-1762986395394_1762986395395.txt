You are working on The Camping Planner app in this Replit project.
There is a bug in the grocery list flow:

Current broken behaviour
	1.	Go to the Trips page, open a trip (e.g., “California”), then expand Meals for this Trip – you will see a meal (e.g., “Campfire Truffle Mac with Bacon”) with its ingredients listed correctly.
	2.	Go to Grocery → Build Your Grocery List.
	•	In Meals from your trips, choose that trip and tick the meal.
	•	You see a toast like “Added to grocery selection! 12 ingredients from [meal name]”.
	3.	Click Continue to Review.
	4.	The resulting grocery list page is empty – none of the ingredients appear. Sometimes, if you come in fresh, the grocery area shows “No Recipes Yet”.

Goal
Fix the grocery builder so that:
	•	When the user selects one or more meals from a trip and clicks Continue to Review, a grocery list is created that actually contains all of the ingredients from those meals.
	•	Ingredients from multiple meals are merged and grouped by category (pantry, dairy, produce, etc.) using whatever grouping logic already exists in the project.
	•	The list is persisted, not just held in in-memory React state, so users can:
	•	revisit the list later,
	•	see it counted in their “usage statistics” (e.g., “0/5 grocery lists used”),
	•	share/export/email it as intended.

Implementation hints
	•	Inspect the components/pages responsible for this flow. Likely candidates:
	•	pages/grocery/build.tsx or similar for the “Build Your Grocery List” screen.
	•	A grocery list review/details page, maybe under pages/grocery/[id].tsx or a GroceryListReview component.
	•	Any API routes like /api/grocery-lists or /api/grocery/selection used when clicking Continue to Review.
	•	Find where the toast “Added to grocery selection! … ingredients from …” is emitted. Track what state or data structure is being updated (e.g., selectedIngredients, pendingGrocerySelection, groceryDraft, etc.).
	•	Make sure that Continue to Review:
	1.	Reads the same selection data used for the toast.
	2.	Aggregates the ingredients from the selected meals:
	•	For each selected trip meal, pull its ingredients from the same source used by the Meals for this Trip accordion (do not rely on “My Recipes only” if you have an ExternalRecipe type).
	•	Normalise and merge ingredients with the same name (e.g., combine multiple cheese entries into one item with a total quantity if quantity parsing already exists; otherwise at least list them together).
	3.	Persists them by:
	•	creating a grocery_lists record (user_id, trip_id, created_at, etc.),
	•	creating associated grocery_list_items rows (grocery_list_id, ingredient_name, category, notes, maybe quantity fields).
	4.	Redirects the user to the created grocery list page (e.g., /grocery/list/[id]) instead of an empty state.
	•	Update the “No Recipes Yet / Create Your First Recipe” empty state so it does not appear when the user is coming in with selected trip meals. In that case, go straight to the grocery review screen populated with items.

Validation
	•	Run the app and follow this exact scenario:
	1.	Create a trip, add at least one meal (external recipe is fine if that’s all you have).
	2.	On the trip page, confirm the meal shows ingredients.
	3.	Go to Grocery → Build Your Grocery List, select that trip and meal, then click Continue to Review.
	4.	Verify that:
	•	The grocery list page shows the correct ingredients.
	•	A new grocery_lists record and associated items exist in the database.
	•	The user’s “Usage Statistics” (grocery list count) is updated.
	•	Add basic error handling and console logging around the Continue to Review submission so that future issues are easier to debug.
