Open client/src/pages/Recipes.tsx (or wherever the “From TheCampingPlanner.com” external recipes list is rendered).

Right now the page is showing some long “blog-type” posts from the feed that aren’t actual recipes. Please filter them out so they don’t show in the external recipes section.

Specifically, remove any external recipe whose title matches any of these strings:

"25 Delicious and Easy Sides For Camping to Elevate Your Outdoor Meals"

"Camping Food: Easy Meal Planning, Campfire Recipes & Must-Have Cooking Gear"

"Snack Ideas for Hiking For Fueling Your Outdoor Adventures"

"Cozy Winter Camping Meals To Keep You Warm & Energized"

"23 Easy Griddle Recipes For Camping"

"22 Must-Try Skillet Meals for Camping: Convenient One-Pot Dinners"

"25 Easy Camping Meals for Kids: Kid-Friendly Campfire Recipes"

"Best Camping Snacks To Make Ahead Or Buy For Your Camping Trip"

"25 Easy Crock Pot Camping Meals To Make For Your Next Trip"

"Best Canned Food For Camping & Easy No-Chill Meal Ideas"

"Outdoor Cooking For Beginners: Tips For Your Camping Trip"

Implementation detail:

After you fetch/build the externalRecipes array, add a filter step:

const blockedTitles = [
  "25 Delicious and Easy Sides For Camping to Elevate Your Outdoor Meals",
  "Camping Food: Easy Meal Planning, Campfire Recipes & Must-Have Cooking Gear",
  "Snack Ideas for Hiking For Fueling Your Outdoor Adventures",
  "Cozy Winter Camping Meals To Keep You Warm & Energized",
  "23 Easy Griddle Recipes For Camping",
  "22 Must-Try Skillet Meals for Camping: Convenient One-Pot Dinners",
  "25 Easy Camping Meals for Kids: Kid-Friendly Campfire Recipes",
  "Best Camping Snacks To Make Ahead Or Buy For Your Camping Trip",
  "25 Easy Crock Pot Camping Meals To Make For Your Next Trip",
  "Best Canned Food For Camping & Easy No-Chill Meal Ideas",
  "Outdoor Cooking For Beginners: Tips For Your Camping Trip",
];

const filteredExternalRecipes = externalRecipes.filter(
  (r) => !blockedTitles.includes(r.title.trim())
);


Then render filteredExternalRecipes instead of the original list.

Save and re-run the app.
