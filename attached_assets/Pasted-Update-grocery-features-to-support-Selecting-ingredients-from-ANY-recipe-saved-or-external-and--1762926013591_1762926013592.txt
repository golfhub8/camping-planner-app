Update grocery features to support:
- Selecting ingredients from ANY recipe (saved or external) and adding them to a single “current list”.
- Adding meals from the selected Trip directly into the current list.
- Dedupe and aggregate like items (e.g., “cheddar cheese” 1 cup + 2 cups -> 3 cups). Keep unit if identical; if units differ, note both.
- “Already have it” vs “Need to buy” toggle (persist per user).
- Share: add a “Copy” button AND an “Email this list” button (mailto + server email route).

Changes:

1) Add server route for optional email send
- In `server/routes.ts` add:
  - `POST /api/grocery/share` with body `{ to: string, subject: string, html: string }`
  - Use nodemailer with `SMTP_HOST, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS` env vars.
  - Return `{ ok: true }` on success.

2) Data model
- In memory per user (or DB if available), store a “current grocery session”
  - `{ items: Array<{ id, name, note?, qty?, unit?, have?:boolean, source?: 'recipe'|'custom', recipeId?:string }>, lastUpdated }`
- Expose:
  - `POST /api/grocery/session/reset`
  - `GET /api/grocery/session`
  - `POST /api/grocery/session/add-items` (array)
  - `POST /api/grocery/session/toggle-have` (id -> flips have)
  - `POST /api/grocery/session/remove` (id)
  - `POST /api/grocery/session/aggregate` (server returns an aggregated view)

3) Frontend: new Grocery page
- Replace `client/src/pages/GroceryList.tsx` with a 3-panel layout:
  A) “Pick sources”
     - Dropdown: “Meals from your trip” (lists trips; when chosen, fetch meals -> show each meal’s ingredients with checkboxes; “Add selected to list”)
     - “Your saved recipes” grid; clicking opens an ingredient picker modal (like Meals section) with “Add selected to list”
     - “Quick Add” single item (name, qty, unit, note) -> append
  B) “Your list”
     - Two tabs: “Need to buy” and “Already have”
     - Each item: checkbox (moves between tabs), editable qty/unit/note, delete
     - “Aggregate view” switch that groups by name+unit
  C) “Share/Export”
     - Buttons: “Copy list”, “Email list” (opens modal collect email -> calls `/api/grocery/share`), “Download CSV”

4) Aggregation rules
- Normalize names by trimming and lowercasing; keep original casing for display.
- Aggregate only when unit matches AND both have numeric qty.
- If units differ or qty missing, list multiple bullets under same item name in the aggregated view with notes.

5) Ingredient picker re-use
- Reuse the modal used in Trips “Meals for this Trip” (checkboxes + Select All + Add Selected).
- Wherever a recipe card exists (“My Recipes”, “From TheCampingPlanner.com”, the recipe detail modal), add an “Add to Grocery” button that launches the picker.

6) Email share
- Add a modal with email input; POST to `/api/grocery/share` with HTML produced from the aggregated list (include trip name if present).
- Also render a `mailto:` fallback that pre-fills subject/body.

Be careful:
- Do NOT lose existing state management for “Camping Basics” – move those to the new list as a collapsible preset library (“Add Camping Basics”) that appends items to the session.
- Keep the existing “Share Grocery List” button on the Trip page, but route it to the new Grocery page with the trip pre-selected via query param `?tripId=...`.
