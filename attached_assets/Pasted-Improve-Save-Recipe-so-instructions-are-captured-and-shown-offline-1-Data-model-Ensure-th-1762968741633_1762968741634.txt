Improve "Save Recipe" so instructions are captured and shown offline.

1) Data model:
   - Ensure the Recipe schema (client and server) includes:
     {
       id, title, ingredients: IngredientItem[], steps: string[], imageUrl?: string, sourceUrl?: string, createdAt
     }
     IngredientItem has: { name: string, quantity?: string, notes?: string, section?: string }
   - Update any Supabase/DB table migration if needed to add a 'steps' JSON column and 'image_url', 'source_url' fields.

2) Parser:
   - The existing external recipe fetch/scrape logic should try in order:
     a) JSON-LD Recipe (look for @type 'Recipe') — read 'recipeInstructions' (string or HowToStep[]), 'image', 'name', 'recipeIngredient'
     b) microdata / OpenGraph fallback
     c) As a last resort, keep current manual text capture but **do not** show the raw “Ingredients (one per line)” input if we successfully parsed JSON-LD.
   - Put this logic in a utility: client/src/lib/recipeScraper.ts and reuse on the page that handles Save Recipe.

3) UI changes:
   - In the “Save Recipe” modal/component (client/src/components/RecipeSaveModal.tsx or wherever it lives):
     • Show a preview: Title, Ingredients count, Steps count
     • Allow user edits to both ingredients and steps before saving (simple text areas OR per-item editing)
     • Remove or hide the "Ingredients (one per line)" fallback when we already parsed JSON-LD.
     • Add a little note “Saved for offline use” when steps are present.

4) My Recipes view:
   - In client/src/pages/Recipes.tsx (or /RecipeDetail.tsx), ensure we render both the Ingredients checklist and a Steps column for saved recipes.
   - Add a "Print" button (prints the offline recipe view).

5) When exporting to grocery list, continue to use the parsed ingredients. Steps are informational only.

6) QA:
   - Try saving two articles from TheCampingPlanner.com that have JSON-LD; confirm steps appear.
   - Confirm that a purely manual recipe still allows typing ingredients and steps before saving.
