I’m continuing the same Node.js + Express project called The Camping Planner.
The recipes module is already working (recipes can be created, stored in @replit/database, listed, and viewed at /recipe/:id).

Now I want to build the Grocery List feature that connects to those recipes.

Functional requirements

Create a new route file called /routes/grocery.js and mount it in index.js at /grocery.

Add a simple HTML page with a list of all saved recipes (title + checkbox).

When the user selects one or more recipes and clicks “Generate Grocery List,” the server should:

Collect all the ingredients from the selected recipes.

Merge duplicates (e.g., if “milk” appears twice, keep one).

Group ingredients by type: Produce, Dairy, Meat, Pantry, Camping Gear (misc).

Show them on a new page /grocery/list with checkboxes next to each item.

Each item should have a checkbox. When checked, it means “already have it.”

Add a “Show Only Needed Items” toggle that hides the checked ones.

Add a “Share List” button that opens a new page /grocery/share which displays only unchecked items in a clean copyable list format (so the user can text or email it).

Include a “Back to Recipes” and “Back to Grocery List” button for easy navigation.

Technical notes

Use the same @replit/database to fetch recipes (you can reuse the database object).

The grocery list can be built dynamically; you don’t need to store it permanently yet.

Keep the code organized and commented because I’m still learning.

Use simple HTML templates or inline strings for now, no frameworks needed.

At the top of each grocery-related page, show a small header:
“The Camping Planner – Grocery List Builder” with a link back to /.

Example flow

Go to /grocery

Select recipes → click “Generate Grocery List”

See combined ingredients, grouped by type, each with a checkbox

Click “Show Only Needed Items” to hide checked ones

Click “Share List” → show a clean copyable list of only unchecked items

Once done, explain what files were created or modified and how to run it inside Replit.
