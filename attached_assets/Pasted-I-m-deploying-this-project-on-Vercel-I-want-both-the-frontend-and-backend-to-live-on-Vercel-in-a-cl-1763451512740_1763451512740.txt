I’m deploying this project on Vercel. I want both the frontend and backend to live on Vercel in a classic “frontend + Vercel serverless functions” setup. The api folder in the repo should define my backend endpoints (for example /api/ping, /api/auth/user, /api/auth/login, /api/trips, etc.).

Right now I’m getting errors when the app tries to log in or hit API routes on https://thecampingplanner.app. Please do the following:
	1.	Scan the project and list all API routes that are actually implemented for Vercel – especially in the api/ folder and any serverless-function-style files. Tell me exactly which HTTP methods and paths exist (for example, GET /api/ping, POST /api/auth/login, GET /api/auth/user, etc.).
	2.	Make sure there is a login endpoint implemented under a clear path like POST /api/auth/login (or similar). If it isn’t implemented yet, create a minimal login handler in the appropriate api/*.ts file that matches the rest of the auth system in this project (use the same user/session logic currently used on Replit).
	3.	In the frontend (inside the client folder), update all API calls so they use relative paths that match the actual backend routes. For example, if the login route is POST /api/auth/login, then the frontend should call that exact path using fetch("/api/auth/login", ...) or using the apiUrl() helper with a base that assumes same-origin (no hard-coded Replit URLs).
	4.	Remove any remaining hard-coded Replit .repl.co URLs or replit.com/@... URLs from the frontend code. All API calls should be relative to the current origin (the Vercel domain), e.g. /api/....
	5.	Ensure the apiUrl helper in client/src/lib/api.ts is compatible with this: if VITE_API_BASE_URL is defined, it should prefix that; if not, it should just return the path unchanged so local dev and production on Vercel both work with relative /api/... calls.
	6.	After making changes, verify in the code that:
	•	A request to /api/ping will return a response when deployed on Vercel.
	•	A request to /api/auth/user and the login route (e.g. /api/auth/login) are correctly wired and match what the frontend is calling.

Do not change any domain or DNS settings; just align the frontend and backend routes so that everything works when hosted entirely on Vercel.
