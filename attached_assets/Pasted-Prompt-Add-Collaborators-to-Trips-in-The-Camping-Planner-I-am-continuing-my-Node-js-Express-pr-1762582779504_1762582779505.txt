Prompt: Add Collaborators to Trips in “The Camping Planner”

I am continuing my Node.js + Express project called “The Camping Planner.”
I already have a trips module (/trips) where I can:

list all trips

create a new trip

view a single trip at /trips/:id

attach recipes/meals to that trip

Now I want to add a simple collaborator/invite feature to trips.

What I want

Each trip object in the database should have a new field called collaborators, which is an array of strings (usually emails or names).
Example:

{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "Goldstream Weekend",
  "location": "Goldstream Provincial Park",
  "startDate": "2025-05-01",
  "endDate": "2025-05-03",
  "meals": [],
  "collaborators": ["mom@example.com", "uncle@family.com"]
}


On the Trip Detail page (GET /trips/:id), show a new section:

“Collaborators on this trip”

list all current collaborators

a small form: “Add collaborator (email or name)”

When the form is submitted, it should send a POST request to something like:
POST /trips/:id/collaborators

This route should:

read the existing trip from @replit/database

push the new collaborator value into the collaborators array (only if not empty)

save the trip back

redirect back to /trips/:id

Please update the trip-creation logic so that new trips start with collaborators: [] to avoid undefined errors.

Add basic validation so if the input is blank, it does not crash — just redirect back.

Add comments in the code because I am still learning.

On the Trip Detail page, under the collaborators list, show a little helper text like:

“Share this trip with family members so they can see meals, grocery lists, and printable games.”

I don’t have real user authentication yet, so this can just store the emails/names as strings. No login needed right now. Just make it future-friendly so I can later check “if current user is in collaborators.”

Summary of routes to add

POST /trips/:id/collaborators → add a collaborator to that trip

update GET /trips/:id view to display collaborators and the add form

After generating the code, tell me which files you edited (likely routes/trips.js and maybe index.js) so I know where to look.
